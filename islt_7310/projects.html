        <h2>Agile Project Management</h2>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Summary:</span> In this course, I was tasked with using a project management style (the scrum style of project management) with a team member to create a virtual tour of Da Vinci’s workshop. The project was the primary deliverable for this course, but updates were kept through the use of our project management system.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Process:</span> My partner and I started by dividing the work for the project by skills we possessed or wanted to enhance. For this project there was a great deal to do and not too much time to do it. My partner was tasked with getting all pertinent information regarding Da Vinci and some of his works, while I created the wireframe for our powerpoint showing how we would be designing the layout and production of a coherent information package. The next week was a bit slow as there was sickness involved and communication between us faltered. By the third week, we both regained our focus, began to put the project together and made desirable progress with the power point. In the fourth and final week our team completed any final editing needed to finish our project.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">My Role:</span> Much of what I did was the “behind the scenes” work. To start the project, I initiated the design of the power point and created a very basic wireframe.  The second week began with using the information and video found by my partner and splicing all the pieces together into a coherent and fluid format. During the second week, my partner became ill and therefore we did not have much communication. To ensure the timely completion of our project I took over some of her work. When working on a project with a deliverable due in a strict time frame, the team cannot always foresee these interruptions but must be flexible and creative to be ensure the product is finalized. In the third and fourth weeks I completed the video editing, putting everything into the power point, timing out all portions of the project (video with voice over), and ensuring all links on the pages would work as intended. My partner and I used the online Zoho program to update and evaluate our progress using a scrum management method. Each week we took screenshots of the progress of our work and created a small write up stating what was successful, unsuccessful and what we needed to change in order to improve our next “sprint.”</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Artifact:</span> Our goal for this project was to create a virtual tour of Da Vinci’s workshop using the scrum style of project management. The artifact is the final project. You will hear my partner's voice in the project. She wrote the initial dialog and I edited the script to fit the time requirements of the video. <a href="#La%20Mano%20di%20Da%20Vinci%20Video.mp4">La Mano di Da Vinci Video</a></p> This artifact is too big to upload. Send me an e-mail if you want me to get you a copy!
    <p><span class="boldbig">Reflection:</span> The project required a great deal of work, cooperation and organization, but flowed very smoothly outside of the week of illness. I was skeptical of how much work could be done by two people in such a short amount of time but was pleasantly surprised. Both my partner and I have our lives we live outside of the classroom, we both had personal issues come up and encountered situations to hold us back. Overcoming these trials only helped to solidify the skills learned in being able to conduct, implement, and be a part of a project management team. With these variables I feel as though I encountered and overcame obstacles one would find in the work environment. Besides the technical skills I honed, I developed and refined interpersonal skills that will be valuable in any work environment.</p>
    
    <h2>Design and Development of Online Learning</h2>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Summary:</span> In this course, groups were tasked with creating an in-depth course for teachers to enhance their performance in the classroom. The team decided to focus our course on the universal design for learning (UDL) framework, and by having those who would take our course learn this process. </p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Process:</span> For this project the team members divided our work into smaller sections based on our strengths. Two people collaborated on each section to provide a variety of ideas and support with technical aspects. All team members worked with each other at one point during the project. Weekly meetings were held to give updates on successes and any roadblocks we encountered.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">My Role:</span> My main focus and contributions were in sections two, three and five, although I took on some revision work in sections one and four as well. Section two was all about the “connect activity”. We had to come up with a learning project that would have the students combining the “absorb” and “do” activities they had completed throughout the entire module. We determined a schema for students to create their lesson plans while consistently evaluating themselves. Each step of the process is repeatable until the desired outcome is reached. Section three was the grading rubric, and was the most straightforward section. All goals and steps required by students were delineated in order to eliminate confusion, and to ensure appropriate feedback when students received their grades. Section five was an explanation and discussion of meaningful learning. The team decided to focus on four of the five areas of meaningful learning which were, active, authentic, intentional and constructive/cooperative. We found those to be the most effective for our project’s goals. </p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Artifact:</span> The final portion of the project spans the first 13 pages of the artifact file. Pages 14 and onward were remakes of the first “phase” of the project. Section one is a large table that explains the objectives, assessments and learning activities. Bloom’s Taxonomy regarding the hierarchy of learning was used to evaluate the objectives and assessments. Section two was the “connect activity”. The activity was a way for our students to think deeply about their choices regarding lesson plan building. Section three was the grading rubric, broken down into desired criteria and ratings. The ratings gave specific feedback as to what work was given and why the student would receive that grade. Section four was to create a multiple-choice assessment, having only two questions and was designed as a simulation of how the questions would be implemented. Section five was the defense and rationale of how our project developed meaningful learning and was aligned to ensure efficiency. <a href="docs/Design%20Challenge-Part%202.pdf">Design Challenge</a></p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Reflection:</span> In developing this course for teachers in the use of the universal design for learning, the students would engage in direct instruction but also constructivist learning as they developed their lesson plans. Our design was to support their learning through ‘absorb, do and connect’ activities. The developed course would engage students and provide appropriate technology usage. In working with a team to develop this program I found that we also accomplished all of those objectives for ourselves as we expanded our learning, negotiated and cooperated to produce an excellent product. </p>

    <h2><span class="bold">Competency 2: Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation</span></h2>
    <p>(student) I developed critical and analytical skills for data collection and evaluation and can reflect and apply these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems.</p>
    <p> <span class="bold">Goals:</span> To provide students with experiences to develop skills in data collection, analysis and evaluation for reflecting on and applying to the design/development of learning opportunities and systems.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Objectives:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Objective 2.1: Students are able to conduct analysis in order to translate and use theoretical frameworks and existing research to design/develop learning opportunities and systems.</li>
        <li>Objective 2.2: Students are able to manage and optimize analytics collected by learning and performance systems to develop criteria to measure learning impact and talent development.</li>
    </ol>
        
         <h2>Grant Writing</h2>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Summary:</span> In this course, I was tasked with developing a grant. Through the course, students were assigned to create a grant that would be usable in our current occupation. I chose to write a grant proposal to assist True North, a domestic abuse shelter in Columbia Missouri. </p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Process:</span> The course began by having all students determine a purpose for their grant and to create a one page proposal template. I chose to have my grant be designed to help people who have been victims of domestic abuse through the creation of a self-defense course entitled WISH, Women in Self Help. Funding for WISH would be provided by this grant. Throughout the rest of the course, I created parts of the grant (applicant information, background, goals/objectives, etc.), evaluated past grants and what made them successful (or unsuccessful) and attempted to emulate their good qualities in my work. During the final two weeks of the course, the class was asked to read and peer review each other’s grants. After taking the responses into consideration, I made my final revisions and sent in the final proposal for the class.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">My Role:</span> In this course, I was to take the role of the grant writer. I had no experience with writing grants up to this point and found some parts to be rather challenging and other parts to be quite simple. I had to come up with a good reason for my grant proposal that would be applicable to my current occupation. As a security guard and police officer I had recently worked on a domestic assault case. This being so fresh in my mind gave me a good source of motivation for this endeavor. Finding an appropriate grant/funding source was rather difficult. With a bit of assistance finding funding sources from other students, I came across the Petit Family Foundation. From there, I completed research regarding the funding foundation and my cause. I found a wealth of information with respect to crime in the local area and data from True North. Regarding the Petit Family Foundation, the important information I found was concerning their grant requirements, and ensuring that what I would propose and bring to fruition would be acceptable to the granting agency. The peer evaluations that I completed for my fellow classmates was invaluable to my own proposal as I saw exemplary models that I could incorporate, as well as deficits that I needed to revise in my own work. The critique I obtained on my own proposal greatly benefited my final proposal.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Artifact:</span> The important sections begin with the background. This is where I conducted and summarized major research that supported the grant, both in showing the importance of why I was requesting the grant, but also for solidifying my ideas so they aligned with those of the granting agency. The project description was very time consuming, as I developed an in-depth breakdown of the goals and outcomes that would be produced by the grant if I were to receive it. <a href="docs/Robinson%20Grant%20Proposal.pdf">Petit Family Foundation Grant Proposal</a></p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Reflection:</span> Grant writing requires a great deal research, evaluation, preparation and a unique set of writing skills. Determining a reason for a grant and having a rough idea of what I would like to do with the allocated funds was the easiest part. My current occupations provided an insight into a need in our community. Finding a granting agency that has a similar vision to myself and would fit the parameters of my proposal proved to be difficult. Analyzing all potential agencies available and selecting the best one proved to be crucial to ensuring my proposal has the best chance of being selected. After determining the granting agency, researching their history, the requirements for a grant proposal and ensuring that I produce all of those elements required substantial data collection and evaluation. Finally, integrating all of the data, determining the most effective delivery for that information and organizing it in a way that the granting agency required was exhaustive. I know that grant writing is not exactly a learning system, but funding is always needed for any learning system created. Being able to write and apply for grants in order to provide funding for a company (or myself) as needed will be a skill that would be seen as a valuable asset to any future employer.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Proposal</h2>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Summary:</span> In this course, I was tasked with creating a research proposal. We were to pick a topic that we are passionate about and find a way to incorporate that with our proposal. In this course we did not conduct the proposed research. </p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Process:</span> The first week of the course provided insight into the purpose and scope of a research proposal, as well as all aspects that need to be included in a successful proposal. Developing a strong rationale for the research, identifying the problem and giving purpose for the study, conducting a literature review, and creating the methodology for the research were all elements of this endeavor. After learning all aspects of a proposal, I selected my topic. My proposal was in regards to safety on college campuses and the connection between the perception and reality of fear at different locations on the University of Missouri-Columbia campus. The next assigned task was to perform a literature review on my topic and to create annotated bibliographies of the useful information that was discovered. The ensuing weeks were focused on differentiating the types of research methods to be used for the proposal which included qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods. I chose mixed methods as I proposed the use of surveys, focus groups and statistical data. After determining what type of research would fit best with the proposal, I was introduced to and learned to use bibliometrics and research paradigms. After all the research, discovering tips and tricks, and intensive planning, it was time to write the proposal. The next to the last week of the course, a peer review was conducted of two fellow student’s papers. The final week was revising any issues noted in the peer reviews, adding the changes suggested (or not if they did not fit) and after a final edit, submitting the final research proposal.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">My Role:</span>  This course had little teamwork involved, outside of the peer review and any assistance we received from the group messaging boards on Canvas. Like most students, I spent hours reading journals and papers that covered my chosen topic. My original topic was to include the geographic origin of students attending the University of Missouri-Columbia campus to determine if their geographic origin had an impact on their perceptions of safety. This topic ended up being too specific and I could find no significant literature regarding that aspect of the topic. I realized I had to broaden my proposal’s topic and goals to safety on college campuses and the connection between fear, perception, reality and location on the University of Missouri campus. Applying the literature in logical and thoughtful ways was not as difficult as I anticipated, but proved to be very time consuming. After gathering all the data from the literature review, I determined the type of research methodology best suited to the proposal, created the surveys, and developed the focus group questions. The final result was a proposal I am proud of, and exemplifies the in-depth analytical skills that were developed during the course.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Artifact:</span> The first two pages of the file are in regards to some of the reviewer suggestions that were given to me during the peer reviews. The title page for the proposal begins on the third page of the file. All major sections are identified by bold headings. The references begin on page seventeen and appendix on page twenty-two. <a href="docs/Robinson%20Research%20Proposal.pdf">Research Proposal</a></p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Reflection:</span> I found the idea of a research proposal very daunting, but after sifting through all the data, discerning the important parts, making notes of specific data and integrating that into my proposal, I realized the impact this process would have and how much stronger my work would become once I implemented it. This was one of the most impactful courses on understanding the idea of “where do I go from here”. Ideas and concepts are great, but actually digging deep into the numbers, checking to see if what I am trying to research and develop is possible, and creating a strong proposal was enlightening. Through process of writing my proposal I have developed a deeper understanding of measuring potential learning impacts by coherently analyzing data, systematically evaluating its impact on a chosen topic and developing a cohesive plan that would further inform other interested parties of relevant and critical information. </p>

    <h2><span class="bold">Competency 3: Leadership and Social Responsibility</span></h2>
    <p>(student) I developed competencies for socially responsible technology leadership.</p>
    <p> <span class="bold">Goals:</span> To provide students with experiences to become socially responsible, reflective/sensitive on the interaction of technologies & society and act ethically in response to current and future challenges of emerging technologies for learning.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Objectives:</p>

      <h2>Designing Online Learning</h2>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Summary:</span> I was tasked with designing a game that could be played online based on the MIT balanced design framework. Since the topic for the game could be of our choice, I selected a safety/self-defense evaluation game.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Process:</span>  I chose this game because of my background in law enforcement and  self-defense/safety courses I have developed and taught. I was unsure of how I would structure the game or make it accessible online as self-defense applies in physical confrontations. I remembered a training simulation I completed in the police academy called the FATS machine. It was a use of force simulator where we (the player) had to choose what actions to make based off visual and audio stimuli. It was a fast-paced game and I decided to replicate that experience. I created the concepts of the game, involving a voice over to let players know the rules and what actions they can take. The rest of the game plays out similar to a movie, but the player makes the choices of the main character. After the player succeeds or fails, their scenario would provide a score and give feedback based on their performance.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">My Role:</span> This was an individual project so I did all of the work in development, and design of the game. I developed the game based off of a previous training exercise and I created the information regarding how the game would function. I ensured my game would comply with the MIT Balanced Design framework and gave my defense in the project. Finally, I developed the storyboard which gave detailed descriptions of how the game would work, examples of what would happen in the game, and give details on what would happen after the game was completed.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Artifact:</span> The artifact is an explanation of the game, how it follows the MIT Balanced Design framework of Content model, evidence model and a task model. There is also a storyboard explaining how the game would flow when students would play it. <a href="docs/Robinson%20games%20to%20support%20online%20learning%20(ESCAPE).pdf">Self Defense Game for Online Learning</a></p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Reflection:</span> This assignment pushed for me to create a game that would give value if applied to real life scenarios. Looking back at this game, I realized that it could be updated depending on changes in the most updated self-defense praxis. As models of communication and learning are changing, there is a need for training to be online. With the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and people having to stay home, being able to adapt, move lessons, games and teaching materials online for instruction while keeping the validity and intensity of courses is paramount. Besides the relevance of the game topic, ensuring scenarios that are not biased as to age, race, sexual orientation or ethnicity would ensure that training of this type be current to the social situations of the time.</p>
    
    <h2>Microlearning</h2>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Summary:</span> In this course we were tasked with exploring how microlearning works and to incorporate that into our daily lives. As microlearning is quick bursts learning (usually no longer than 3-6-minute courses) I chose to create a critical incident response sheet based on the environmental emergency of a tornado.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Process:</span> I decided on creating a response list for police officers regarding response and preparation to tornados as it was applicable to my life as a police officer. As tornados do not happen throughout the year but are more seasonal, response protocols are not second nature and always remembered in detail. Having a way for officers to have a form they could keep in their patrol bags, in their vehicles or other commonly accessible locations would allow for quick refreshers in times of emergency. If there is not a unified front by all first responders, the result could endanger people by not getting help to them as soon as possible.</p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">My Role:</span> As this was not a group project, I designed the response code and used my agency’s policy as a basis for the project. All first responder agencies have protocols developed to handle emergency situations. As the policies are not necessarily in a format that is quickly and readily available in a time of crisis, I was careful to include all pertinent information and response actions in the policy. </p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Artifact:</span> The artifact is a form that is simple to follow and provides all required facts for the officers to assess and address in times of crisis regarding a tornado. With time being of the essence in an emergency situation, policy needs to be found in a direct, concise and practical format. <a href="docs/Tornado%20Organized%20Response%20Needs%20and%20Delivery%20Operations.pdf">T.O.R.N.A.D.O.</a></p>
    <p><span class="boldbig">Reflection:</span> Microlearning is invaluable when it comes to making adjustments in real life scenarios while on the job. It happens all the time without anyone realizing it but is best utilized when planned and executed with specific goals in mind. Police work is primarily person to person, but we still grow with the times including our use of technology. Each vehicle has a computer in it for dispatch notes, the ability to look up information and a multitude of other functions. Making small notes or having emergency response guides that are easily accessible is not only necessary but would be irresponsible not to have. Police and first responders are questioned and evaluated as to our performance and we respond to an extreme amount and variety of incidents. Because of the stressful nature and diversity of situations it’s to an officer’s benefit to have response codes quickly accessible, especially for events involving citizen safety. The Critical Incident Response Sheet I developed could be a model for response needs either by law enforcement or any agency or personnel tasked with the protection and safety of a community.</p>
