    <h3>Experiences and Expectations</h3>
        <p class="first">My program has had had many challenges and trials that have taken time, perseverance and help from others to get through. I began this program with a fast pace course that was in the summer, so everything was crammed together with no breathing room. Having been out of academia and in the work force for three and a half years, this was quite the wakeup call. I found that the fast paced first course (despite how difficult it was) really helped me get into the mindset I needed to get to where I am now.</p>
        <p class="tab">As this program comes to an end, I have acquired the knowledge and practices of how to assess, collaborate, design and develop projects from scratch, or to improve existing programs. My long-term goal is to develop a company derived on evaluating, advising and enriching future clients so I may support their goals. This course of study has given me the confidence to step out into the world with my head held high, and begin the long walk to achieve that goal.</p>
