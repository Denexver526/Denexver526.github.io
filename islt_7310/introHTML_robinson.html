     Hello everyone, my name is Alex Robinson. Itâ€™s nice to meet you all! My previous experience in web development is through one course here at the University of Missouri, and one course during my undergraduate years at Westminster College. Both courses were geared towards beginners so I have not created anything too extravagant. In this course I hope to create new tools and use different programs to explore the world of web development and application (as I have never used the Brackets program, this has already been happening!) With the skills I learn regarding web development, I want to explore creating online learning programs that can be geared towards specific information to fit any requirements from agencies/businesses that may request my work. My favorite thing to do with my free time is to play games with my friends. The games can be online, card games, board games, role playing, you name it!
