<h1>Alex Robinson</h1>
<h3>Here is some information about me.</h3>
    <ul class="flex4">
        <li id="flex3">My name is Alex Robinson and I live in Columbia Missouri. My background experience is over five years of law enforcement service including work as a security officer at a local college. I have always found success and satisfaction when helping people and with my interest in the use of technology to advance learning I decided to integrate both with a degree in Information Science and Learning Technologies, focusing in Learning Systems Design and Development. My undergraduate degree in education and business has provided me with a strong educational pedagogy. Through law enforcement I have helped people in times of crisis, and with this degree, I plan to pursue work that will help other law enforcement personnel have better training to ensure they are at their best when out in the field.</li>
